# Mine Auth
Mine Auth is an external authentication plugin for Minecraft servers running on the widely used Spigot API.
Mine Auth utilizes:

- Spigot API
- Spring Boot (Backend)
- Vue 3 (Frontend)

Implementing a secure website for users to login externally. This provides a more secure gameplay experience and prevents botted accounts or accounts with invalid UUID's which are typically pirated.

Then follow these steps:
- ensure that your server has ports 8080 and 8081 open for the backend and frontend servers to run
- Drag the MineAuth.jar into your '/plugins' directory

- Once the plugin creates a '/plugins/MineAuth' directory stop the server
- Add the MineAuthServer.jar into the '/plugins/MineAuth/server'
